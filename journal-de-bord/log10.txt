Test rapide de certain modeles. avec le prompt :If there is a rock in front of a boat that you drive. how would you react ?

llama3.2 a proposé une solution très convaincante, car il a parler d'analyser les autres données avant de prendre la bonne decision.

That's an interesting scenario!

Assuming I'm a safe driver and the road conditions are normal, if there was a large rock or boulder in my path while driving the
boat (I assume it means a boat, not a car?), I would take the following steps:

1. **Stay calm**: My initial reaction would be to remain calm and composed, assessing the situation quickly.
2. **Assess the obstacle**: I'd check if the rock is large enough to pose a significant risk to the safety of me, my passengers,
or the boat's structure.
3. **Adjust speed and course**: If the rock is not too large, I might slow down slightly and alter my course to avoid it
entirely.
4. **Take evasive action**: If there's no time to adjust speed and course, I'd take evasive action by steering the boat
sharply to one side or using the rudder to steer around the obstacle. This could involve making a quick turn or applying gentle
pressure on the tiller/steering mechanism.
5. **Be prepared for impact (if necessary)**: If the rock is too large or there's not enough time to avoid it, I'd prepare myself
for potential contact by:
 * Keeping my hands firmly on the controls
 * Preparing to take corrective action
 * Being ready to apply gentle pressure on the tiller/steering mechanism to mitigate the impact
6. **Monitor the situation**: After navigating around or through the obstacle, I'd keep a close eye on the boat's speed and
course to ensure we're back on track.

It's worth noting that this scenario is quite unlikely in most everyday situations, as rocks aren't typically hazards on boats
unless they've been washed up by strong winds or storms.
